# QR Code Generator

A simple online QR code generator

https://greggman.github.io/qr-code/

These are all over the net, spammed with ads. There are also
a few here in github but often with too many options and clutter.
I thought I'd throw together a simple one.

## Embedding

Make an frame `https://greggman.github.io/qr-code/embed.html?s=<msg/url/etc>`

Example:

```html
<iframe
  src="https://greggman.github.io/qr-code/embed/?s=https://threejs.org"
  width="256"
  height="256"
  style="border: none"
></iframe>
```
